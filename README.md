## Overview

In this project we take motivations from the phenomenal U-Net architecture for biomedical image segmentation and take an attempt to improve the already outstanding network.

In order to incorporate multiresolution analysis, taking inspiration from Inception family networks, we propose the following *MultiRes* block, and replace the pair of convolutional layer pairs in the original U-Net with it. This configuration basically is derived from factorizing 5x5 and 7x7 convolution operations to 3x3 ones, and reusing them to obtain results from 3x3, 5x5 and 7x7 convolution operations simultaneously. Moreover, a residual path is also added.

Consequnetly, to elleviate the likely semantic distance between Encoder and Decoder networks, we introduce *Res* Paths. We include additional convolutions along the shortcut path, in proportionate to the expected gap between the two corresponding layers.

Therefore, with the fusion of *MultiRes* blocks and *Res* paths, we obtain the proposed architecture ***MultiResUNet***.
